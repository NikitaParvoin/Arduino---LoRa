LoRa SX1278 Arduino: Description

LoRa SX1278 Arduino: Projects with Hello World and sensor monitoring.  
I have been using various types of short-range and long-range wireless transceivers for a long time.  
Today, for the first time, I'm going to use these LoRa SX1278 modules with a long range and low power consumption together with the Arduino.  
This is a getting started guide, and I will try to present the information as simply as possible.  
First, I'll start with the Hello World example. We will wirelessly send a "Hello World" message to the receiving LoRa module, and then  
I am modifying the same code to monitor an analog sensor. I will use the potentiometer as a sensor,
which, of course, can be replaced with any other sensor depending on your requirements.
